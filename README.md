# NumeriX-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the NumeriX-Tac-Toe GitHub repository! This project was asked in an interview, to design a unique version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Here's the original problem description:

## Problem Description

The task was to create a single-player Tic-Tac-Toe game with a twist that we won't be using the traditional "X" and "O" markers. Instead, we'll use the numbers from 1 to 9, and each of these numbers can only be played once during the game.

Here's how the game works:

- Players take alternate turns to play an unused number (from 1 to 9), starting from an empty board.
- The goal is to be the first player to form a row, column, or diagonal where the numbers add up to 15.
- The challenge lies in strategic thinking and planning your moves to achieve the winning condition while preventing your opponent (the AI) from winning.

## My Solution

For this project, I've designed a basic Java interface that allows players to engage with the game. The key feature of this version is a unique twist on the traditional game, incorporating numbers and the goal of achieving a sum of 15 in rows, columns, or diagonals. The AI implementation in my solution takes random steps from the available moves, providing a fun and unpredictable experience for players.

## Features

- **Unique Gameplay**: NumeriX-Tac-Toe offers a refreshing twist on the traditional game by using numbers and a winning condition of 15.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The Java interface is designed to provide a simple yet enjoyable experience for players.
- **Randomized AI**: The AI takes random steps from available moves, making each game unpredictable and exciting.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Java project in your preferred IDE.
3. Explore the existing interface and gameplay structure.
4. Enjoy playing against the randomized AI!
