# Tic-Tac-Toe with a Twist

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe with a twist GitHub repository! This project presents a single-player Tic-Tac-Toe game where numbers from 1 to 9 are used instead of traditional "X" and "O" markers. The goal is to achieve a row, column, or diagonal with numbers that add up to 15. Your challenge is to create an intelligent AI opponent and provide a user-friendly interface.

## Problem Description

In this unique version of Tic-Tac-Toe:
- Players take turns placing a number (1-9) in an empty square on the board.
- The winner is the player who forms a row, column, or diagonal with numbers that sum to 15.
- Each number can only be used once during the game.

## Implementation

The project includes a Java interface for players to interact with the game. The AI implementation is left for you to create, allowing you to design a strategic AI opponent to challenge players.

## Features
